LazyCopy
=============

A file system minifilter driver and a C# client allow you to create an empty file, which contents will be downloaded from the remote location, when the file is opened for the first time.

Prerequisites
-------

1. Windows 7+
2. [Visual Studio 2015 & WDK 10](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/dn913721.aspx)
3. [WiX toolset](https://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/610859)

Folder structure
-------

- `Driver`
  - `LazyCopyDriver` - minifilter driver that can track file open operations and fetch remote file contents.
  - `LazyCopyDriverInstall` - generates driver installation package.
  - `DriverClientLibrary` - C# library that provides base classes to communicate with the minifilter driver via the [Communication ports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff541931(v=vs.85).aspx).
  - `LazyCopyDriverClient` - LazyCopy C# driver client based on the `DriverClientLibrary`.
- `ToolsAndLibraries`
  - `Utilities` - contains shared helper classes.
  - `EventTracing` - allows collecting and decoding of the [ETW](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb968803(v=vs.85).aspx) events generated by the LazyCopy driver.
  - `SampleClient` - a very basic console C# application that can create files that are understood by the LazyCopy driver.
- `Service\LazyCopySvc` - a user-mode system service that manages the lifetime and configuration of the LazyCopy driver. It can also open files that cannot opened by the driver on behalf of the currently logged in user.
- `Setup` - [WiX](http://wixtoolset.org/) installation package to install driver, service and client applications.

Installation
-------

* Allow unsigned driver installation:
   1. Open CMD as Admin and type: `bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON` ([info](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff553484(v=vs.85).aspx)).
   2. Reboot. This will allow Windows to load drivers signed with the test certificates.
* Compile the entire solution in the Visual Studio for your architecture.
* You can manually install the driver by right clicking on the `.inf` file and choosing `Install`.
* Check that LazyCopyDriver appeared in the `fltmc` output.<br/>Refer to the [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff548166(v=vs.85).aspx) for additional information.<br/> From the Admin CMD:
```
> fltmc
Filter Name                     Num Instances    Altitude    Frame
------------------------------  -------------  ------------  -----
LazyCopyDriver                          7       370021         0
FileInfo                                8        45000         0
```
* Install and start the LazyCopySvc (optional):
```
> sc create LazyCopySvc binPath="<path to LazyCopySvc.exe>" DisplayName="LazyCopySvc"
> sc start LazyCopySvc
```

Usage
-------

Create an empty file that will be fetched on the first access:
```
bin\SampleClient\SampleClient.exe <original file> <new empty file>
```

Getting official
-------

* [Obtain](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh801887.aspx) the code signing certificate. This will take some time.
* Change the [name](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/LazyCopyDriver.inf) of the driver and rename binaries.
* Sign the driver and, optionally, other binaries.
   For example, if you purchased the Symantec certificate, you can use the following command to sign the driver in the post-build step:
```
signtool sign /v /ac "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\CrossCertificates\VRSN_C3_PCA_G5_Root_CA_Cross.cer" /s my /n "<YOUR NAME>" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll /sha1 "<YOUR CERT THUMBNAIL>" "$(TargetPath)\LazyCopyDriver.sys"
&
signtool sign /v /ac "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\CrossCertificates\VRSN_C3_PCA_G5_Root_CA_Cross.cer" /s my /n "<YOUR NAME>" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll /sha1 "<YOUR CERT THUMBNAIL>" "$(TargetPath)\LazyCopyDriver.cat"
```
* Contact Microsoft and get the following values:
  - [LC_REPARSE_TAG](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/Globals.h)
  - [LC_REPARSE_GUID](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/LazyCopyDriver.c) - from [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn641624(v=vs.85).aspx)
  - [Instance1.Altitude](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/LazyCopyDriver.inf) - from [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn508284(v=vs.85).aspx)
* Change those vlaues in the client code:
  - [LazyCopyFileHelper.cs](Driver/LazyCopyDriverClient/LazyCopyFileHelper.cs)
