LazyCopy
=============

An NTFS [minifilter driver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff540402%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) that can replace file contents, when it is accessed for the first time.

For example, with the included C# client you can create an empty file and "map" it to a remote location. When that file is opened, its contents will be downloaded by the driver:
* `c:\temp\copy.txt` can point to the `d:\binaries\source.txt`. When you open the `copy.txt` file for the first time, content is copied from the `source.txt` by the kernel-mode driver.
* `c:\temp\copy.txt` can also point to the `http://www.contoso.org`, but in this case the user-mode service downloads the file from the remote website and stores it locally.

Prerequisites
-------

1. Windows 7+
2. [Visual Studio 2015 & WDK 10](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/dn913721.aspx)
3. [WiX toolset](https://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/610859)

Folder structure
-------

- `Driver`
  - `LazyCopyDriver` - minifilter driver that can track file open operations and fetch remote file contents.
  - `LazyCopyDriverInstall` - generates driver installation package.
  - `DriverClientLibrary` - C# library that provides base classes to communicate with the minifilter driver via the [Communication ports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff541931(v=vs.85).aspx).
  - `LazyCopyDriverClient` - LazyCopy C# driver client based on the `DriverClientLibrary`.
- `ToolsAndLibraries`
  - `Utilities` - contains shared helper classes.
  - `EventTracing` - allows collecting and decoding of the [ETW](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb968803(v=vs.85).aspx) events generated by the driver.
  - `SampleClient` - a basic console C# application that can create files that are understood by the driver.
- `Service\LazyCopySvc` - a user-mode system service that manages the lifetime and configuration of the driver. It can also open/ download files that cannot opened/downloaded by the driver on behalf of the currently logged in user.
- `Setup` - [WiX](http://wixtoolset.org/) installation package to install driver, service and the client applications.

Installation
-------

* Allow unsigned driver installation:
   1. Open CMD as Admin and type: `bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON` ([info](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff553484(v=vs.85).aspx)).
   2. Reboot. This will allow Windows to load drivers signed with the test certificates.
* Compile the entire solution in the Visual Studio for your architecture. Make sure to choose the valid `Target Platform Version` in the `LazyCopyDriver` project settings.
* You can [manually install](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff553484(v=vs.85).aspx) the driver by right clicking on the `.inf` file and choosing `Install`.
* Check that LazyCopyDriver appeared in the `fltmc` command output.
<br/>Refer to the [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff548166(v=vs.85).aspx) for additional information.
<br/>From the Admin CMD:
```
> fltmc
Filter Name                     Num Instances    Altitude    Frame
------------------------------  -------------  ------------  -----
LazyCopyDriver                          7       370021         0
FileInfo                                8        45000         0
```
* Install and start the LazyCopySvc. This is optional and needed, if you want to have a custom download logic (for example, being able to download files via HTTP).
```
> sc create LazyCopySvc binPath="<path to LazyCopySvc.exe>" DisplayName="LazyCopySvc"
> sc start LazyCopySvc
```

Usage
-------

Create an empty file that will be fetched on the first access (admin permissions are required):
```
bin\SampleClient\SampleClient.exe <original file>                    <new empty file>
bin\SampleClient\SampleClient.exe "\\ci_server\bin\build_latest.zip" "c:\temp\build_latest.zip"
bin\SampleClient\SampleClient.exe "http://www.contoso.org"           "c:\temp\contoso_org_content.txt"
bin\SampleClient\SampleClient.exe "d:\data\file_with_data.txt"       "c:\temp\yet_empty_file.txt"
```

Driver signing
-------

* [Get](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh801887.aspx) a code signing certificate.
* [Get](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn170454(v=vs.85).aspx) the cross-certificate. For example, you may want to use the [VeriSign Cross-Certificate](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=321787).
* Sign the driver and, optionally, other binaries.
   For example, if you purchased a VeriSign certificate, you can use the following command to sign the driver in the post-build step:
```
signtool sign /v /s my /n "<YOUR_NAME>" /sha1 "<YOUR_CERT_THUMBNAIL>" /ac "<PATH_TO_CROSS_CERT>" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll "$(TargetPath)\LazyCopyDriver.sys"
&
signtool sign /v /s my /n "<YOUR_NAME>" /sha1 "<YOUR_CERT_THUMBNAIL>" /ac "<PATH_TO_CROSS_CERT>" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll "$(TargetPath)\LazyCopyDriver.cat"
```
For example:
```
signtool sign /v /s my /n "Contoso Org" /sha1 "ACAE8FE867A99F7701BE7F9D3BBDFBB230233386" /ac "VeriSign_Cross_Sign.cer" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll "LazyCopyDriver.sys"
```
Want to reuse the project files?
-------

* Change the [name](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/LazyCopyDriver.inf) of the driver and rename binaries.
* Generate a new GUID for the [ETW provider](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/LazyCopyEtw.mc) and re-create header:
```
mc.exe -z LazyCopyEtw -n -km LazyCopyEtw.mc
```
* Contact Microsoft and get the following values:
  - [LC_REPARSE_GUID](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/LazyCopyDriver.c) - from [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn641624(v=vs.85).aspx)
  - [Instance1.Altitude](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/LazyCopyDriver.inf) - from [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn508284(v=vs.85).aspx)
* (Optional) Change the reparse point tag: [LC_REPARSE_TAG](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/Globals.h).
* Update the client code with the new reparse GUID and tag: [LazyCopyFileHelper.cs](Driver/LazyCopyDriverClient/LazyCopyFileHelper.cs).
* (Optional) Disable the share access override in the [Operations.c](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/Operations.c) (see the 'PreCreateOperationCallback' method).
