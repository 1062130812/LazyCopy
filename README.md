LazyCopy
=============

An NTFS [minifilter driver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff540402%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) that can download file contents from a remote location, when it is read or written for the first time.

Three endpoints are currently supported:
* `c:\temp\copy.txt` => `d:\binaries\source.txt`. Content is copied by the kernel-mode driver.
* `c:\temp\copy.txt` => `\\build_server\source.txt`. If the driver cannot open the file from the kernel-mode, it asks the user-mode service to open that file, and then downloads content in the kernel-mode.
* `c:\temp\copy.txt` => `http://www.contoso.org/`. Driver asks the user-mode service to download that file. You can easily extend the user-mode service to support more endpoints.

Prerequisites
-------

1. Windows 7+
2. [Visual Studio 2015 & WDK 10](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/dn913721.aspx)
3. [WiX toolset](https://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/610859)

Folder structure
-------

- `Driver`
  - `LazyCopyDriver`        - Minifilter driver.
  - `LazyCopyDriverInstall` - Generates driver installation package.
  - `DriverClientLibrary`   - C# library that provides base classes to communicate with the driver via the [Communication ports](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff541931(v=vs.85).aspx).
  - `LazyCopyDriverClient`  - LazyCopy C# driver client based on the `DriverClientLibrary`.
- `ToolsAndLibraries`
  - `Utilities`             - Contains shared helper classes.
  - `EventTracing`          - Allows collecting and decoding of the [ETW](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb968803(v=vs.85).aspx) events generated by the driver.
  - `SampleClient         ` - A basic console C# application that can create files that are understood by the driver.
- `Service\LazyCopySvc`     - A user-mode system service that manages the lifetime and configuration of the driver. It can also open files on behalf of the currently logged in user, or download them per driver request.
- `Setup`                   - [WiX](http://wixtoolset.org/) installation package to install driver, service and the client applications.

Installation
-------

* Allow Windows to load drivers signed with the test certificates:
   1. Open CMD as Admin and type ([info](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff553484(v=vs.85).aspx)): `bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON`
   2. Reboot.
* Compile the entire solution in the Visual Studio <i>for your architecture</i>. Make sure to choose the valid `Target Platform Version` in the `LazyCopyDriver` project settings.
* You can manually install the driver by right clicking on the `.inf` file and choosing `Install`.
* Check that LazyCopyDriver appeared in the `fltmc` command output ([info](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff548166(v=vs.85).aspx)).
<br/>From the Admin CMD:
```
> fltmc
Filter Name                     Num Instances    Altitude    Frame
------------------------------  -------------  ------------  -----
LazyCopyDriver                          7        180610        0
FileInfo                                8        45000         0
```
Depending on the load type specified in the `.inf` file, it might not be automatically loaded. You can do it manually:
```
> fltmc load lazycopydriver
```
* Install and start the LazyCopySvc. It is optional and needed, if you want to have a custom download logic (for example, being able to download files via HTTP) or share the stub files over the network.
```
> sc create LazyCopySvc binPath="<Absolute_path_to_LazyCopySvc.exe>" DisplayName="LazyCopySvc"
> sc start LazyCopySvc
```

Usage
-------

Create an empty file that will be fetched on the first access (admin permissions are required):
```
bin\SampleClient\SampleClient.exe <original file>                        <new empty file>
bin\SampleClient\SampleClient.exe "\\build_server\bin\latest_drop.zip"   "c:\temp\build_latest.zip"
bin\SampleClient\SampleClient.exe "http://www.contoso.org/"              "c:\temp\contoso_org_content.txt"
bin\SampleClient\SampleClient.exe "d:\data\file_with_data.txt"           "c:\temp\yet_empty_file.txt"
```

Driver signing
-------

* [Get](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh801887.aspx) a code signing certificate.
* [Get](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn170454(v=vs.85).aspx) the cross-certificate for it. You may want to use the [VeriSign Cross-Certificate](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=321787).
* Sign the driver and, optionally, other binaries.
  If you purchased a VeriSign certificate, you can use the following command to sign the driver in the post-build step:
```
signtool sign /v /s my /n "<YOUR_NAME>" /sha1 "<YOUR_CERT_THUMBNAIL>" /ac "<PATH_TO_CROSS_CERT>" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll "$(TargetPath)\LazyCopyDriver.sys"
&
signtool sign /v /s my /n "<YOUR_NAME>" /sha1 "<YOUR_CERT_THUMBNAIL>" /ac "<PATH_TO_CROSS_CERT>" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll "$(TargetPath)\LazyCopyDriver.cat"
```
For example:
```
signtool sign /v /s my /n "Contoso Org" /sha1 "CAFEBEBE0123456701BE7F9D3BBDFBB230233386" /ac "c:\temp\VeriSign_Cross_Sign.cer" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll "$(TargetPath)\LazyCopyDriver.sys"
```

Want to reuse the project files?
-------

* Change the [name](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/LazyCopyDriver.inf) of the driver and rename binaries.
* [Generate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa385638(v=vs.85).aspx) a new GUID for the [ETW provider](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/LazyCopyEtw.mc) and re-create header:
```
mc.exe -z LazyCopyEtw -n -km LazyCopyEtw.mc
```
* Contact Microsoft and get the following values:
  - [LC_REPARSE_GUID](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/LazyCopyDriver.c) - from [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn641624(v=vs.85).aspx)
  - [Instance1.Altitude](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/LazyCopyDriver.inf) - from [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn508284(v=vs.85).aspx)
* (Optional) Change the reparse point tag: [LC_REPARSE_TAG](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/Globals.h).
* Update the client code with the new reparse GUID and tag: [LazyCopyFileHelper.cs](Driver/LazyCopyDriverClient/LazyCopyFileHelper.cs).
* (Optional) Disable the sharing access override in the [Operations.c](Driver/LazyCopyDriver/Operations.c) (see the `PreCreateOperationCallback` method).
